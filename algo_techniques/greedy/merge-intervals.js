/*
 * Merge Overlapping Intervals
 * 
 * Problem:
 *  Given a set of intervals (e.g. time) in any order, merge all overlapping 
 *  intervals. Output one or more mutually exclusive intervals.
 * 
 * Simplifications/Assumptions:
 *  Intervals are represented as pairs of integers. Pairs are stored in an
 *  object with the form: 
 *      {startTime: 10, endTime: 20}
