# Arrays

# Definition

Basic building block of higher level data structures, an array is a ordered collection of data grouped together under one name. Data is accessed by means of numeric indexes. Unlike other list-like data structures, arrays are stored in sequential memory.

## Caveats

- Some implementations allow only homogeneous (same type) data where as others allow homogeneous (different types) data to be stored
- Some arrays are dynamic, meaning they can grow to accommodate new data, others are static, meaning the size must be defined at the start.

## ADT

- `set(i, v)` - Assigns the value _v_ to index _i_
- `get(i)` - retrieves the value stored at index _i_

## Language Specifics

### Javascript
