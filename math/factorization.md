# Factorization

## Definition

Two numbers are factors of another number if they can be multiplied together in order to produce the third number.

**Example**: A and B are factors of C if A * B = C

In Algebra, factors are expressions that can be combined to make a larger expression.

**Example**: (X + 2)(X + 1) = X^2 + 3X + 2

## Multiples

The product of multiplying a number (can be any type of number) by an integer (i.e. a whole number).

**Example**: The multiples of 2 are 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 ...

# Addition of consecutive integers
