53 bits with scale factors (power of two), (ie. divisor or multiplication)

- Every number is written is written as factor of two numbers

  - Rounding errors come from the numbers that cannot be represented as fractions. 1/3 or 8106479329266893 / 4503599627370496
  - A number as large as 9007199254740992 cents or $90,071,992,547,409.92

- Optimized for Asynchronous code, callbacks and promises built for

- Functional vs procedural

  - Objects are not mutable
  - javascript is not a pure functional language but it does support many functional paradigms
  - first class functions - pass functions as parameters, closures, return functions
  - Closures are essential to making promises work

    - Without closures you have to rely on passing data from the outer scope

- Cloures are the way of JavaScript

- Prototypal inheritance

  - Cannot inherit from more than one Objects
  - What is a good thing

- Dynamic vs Static

  - Be careful
  - Static type, variables have type
  - Dynamic type, data carries a type
  - Javascript is Dynamic only
  - Pyk? is Static and Dynamic

- Disadvantage: Can pass more parameters than you defined

  - Important part of the language but causes confusion

- Disadvantage: Sloppy language

  - Strict: prove at compile time to be correct

    - Ada and Haskel

  - Sloppy: get something written quickly

    - Javascript and PHP

      - Keep going and produce some kind of result
      - 1e2 == 100 ? True
      - 100 == "100" ? True
      - 100 == "1e2" ? True
      - "100" == "1e2" ? False in JS, True in PHP

- EScript is being pulled in different directions

- X-Hello-Human:

  - Anything starting with a x will be ignored by code -
