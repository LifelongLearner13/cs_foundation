# Objects

## Definition

Collection of related variable and methods that hides the complexities of implementation behind an interface.

### Related concepts

- Encapsulation

  - Grouping data and functions into a "blackbox" with interaction only happening through the exposed data and function calls (aka interface). All implementation details are hidden from the user, because of this the internal code can be changed as long as the interface remains the same.

- Modularity

  - The degree to which code is split up into logical units. If done correctly, modularity allows pieces of code to change without effecting the overall application.

- Abstraction

  - Reduces complexity by separating code and hiding implementation detect behind simpler APIs

- Polymorphism

  - Greek for "many forms", it defines one interface for multiple data types. A core technique in OOP, Polymorphism relates to both plain objects and inheritance. Once defined on a class, each instance of the class (aka object) can use the function or a child class can override information from the parent class.

- Namespace (Name Scope)

  - An abstract container which wraps functionality under a unique application-specific name. An identifier defined in a namespace is associated only with that namespace.
  - In **Javascript** there are no language-level difference between regular objects and namespaces.

- Class

  - In classical OOP, a class is a template for the functionality of an object

- Object

  - An instance of a class

- Property

  - Characteristic of an object. Associated with a noun.

- Method

  - Function associated with a class. Associated with an action (aka verb).

- Constructor

  - A method called with an object is instantiated. It usually has the same name as the class.

- Inheritance

  - Usually described in terms of a parent/child relationship. By means of their connection the child has access to the properties and methods of the parent.
